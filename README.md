###Goal

Examine detection probability parameters and identify a model/models suitable for all CRFPO PIT sites in an effort to improve antenna efficiency estimates.

###Analysis

Here's a random graph:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```



This is a draft document with the intent of evolving into a comprehensive SOP for PIT antenna installation.
